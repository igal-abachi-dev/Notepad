# Notepad
Notepad (classic) written in C# + Avalonia UI + Native AOT 


in windows 11 , notepad changed from being light single exe (c++ win32 based on windows messages and gdi and com dialogs),
into c++ winrt(uwp/winui xaml) with richtext markdown , tabs , restart manager , cowriter ai.... and more bloat
but they removed the simplicity it had , and made it slower load and heavy

so this is remaking the classic notepad on modern stack
